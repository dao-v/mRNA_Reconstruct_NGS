# mRNA Reconstruction using RNA-Seq Next-Generation Sequencing Data
The goal of this project is to reconstruct mRNA from RNA-Seq data. 
In this specific situation, the RNA-Seq was extracted from healthy patients and patients diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. 
Thus, this project examines the preproinsulin mRNA (pre-precursor of the insulin hormone/protein) of pancreatic beta cells.

### How to Run:
Check all the imports in the next cell and install all packages you are missing.
Then simply run the cells.
Smaller necessary files are included in this GitHub repository while other files will be downloaded from this notebook.
Download speeds from the European Bioinformatics Institute vary and could take a while.
Estimated time to completion: About a week
The final products of most interest are probably in these folders: Counts, Reconstruct, and Summary.

#### System Requirements:
This project requires about 40 GBs of storage (NGS data are large files).
RAM storage will likely not be a large issue for most computers.
